## Create a work branch
You must be in `master` branch to create a working branch.

Check working branch:
```sh
# cd to your project folder
git branch
```

The result is similar to
```sh
* master
```

The `*` indicate the current branch. If you need to change the branch type:
```sh
# cd to your project folder
git checkout master
```

From `master` branch create a new branch to work:
```sh
# cd to your project folder
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

The branch is ready to work.
